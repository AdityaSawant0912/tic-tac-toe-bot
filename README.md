This is the code repository for my Medium Series - [Playing Games with Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-beat-games-using-a-bunch-of-code-part-1-tic-tac-toe-1543e981fec1), where I try to take a game and apply algorithms from game theory, deep learning, reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms and other exciting algorithm in an attempt to create AI bots able enough to beat humans, if not the game.
